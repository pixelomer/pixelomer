# Hi, I'm pixel! 👋🏻

I mix tools that were never meant to be used together and watch as hilarity ensues.

- Breakout game for pongoOS, the iOS pre-boot environment: [PongoBRIX](https://github.com/pixelomer/PongoBRIX)
- Discord as a FUSE filesystem: [discord-fs](https://github.com/pixelomer/discord-fs)
- An annoying goose for iPhone: [MobileGoose](https://github.com/pixelomer/MobileGoose)
- `sl` train that travels between computers: [sl-web](https://github.com/pixelomer/sl-web)

I also created [TweakReviewsDB](https://tweakreviews.pixelomer.com), a platform for reviewing tweaks and applications for jailbroken devices.
